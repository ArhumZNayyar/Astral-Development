# Astral-Development
2D Platformer C++ Game Using SDL2.0 Graphics Engine (No longer public).


The privatization of Astral source code:

Astral, is a project that has grown incredibly close to my heart.

When I began working on Astral, it was something born from a whim into the world of game developmentâ€”a space to learn, experiment, and express my creativity. The game started as a public repository on GitHub, a testament to my learning process and progress.

Over time, I realized a dream. What began as a simple learning project evolved into a refined, beautiful game that I believe has the potential to offer a unique experience to its future players. I've poured countless hours, a lot of passion, and a piece of myself into Astral, and I'm determined to see it shape up into something I never initially imagined possible, a story by me.

And so, with this evolution comes a significant decision. To prepare for the future of Astral, I've decided to transition the game's source code from a public to a private repository. This change isn't just about the commercial aspect; it's about making Astral to be something personal by me unto others, ensuring its quality, and respecting the journey it represents.

With that said, development updates will be periodically posted in this repo. Thank you for reading my message.
